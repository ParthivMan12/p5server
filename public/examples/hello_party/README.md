# hello_party

This example shows how to connect to a party server, load a shared data object, and read and write to it. It also shows how to share a p5 color.

This example is the same `hello_cdn` but uses a local copy of p5.party. The JavaScript is exactly the same, the only difference is in the html file.

Loading p5.party from a local file removes a dependency on the CDN.

Loading p5.party from a local file:

```html
<script src="/dist/p5.party.js"></script>
```
