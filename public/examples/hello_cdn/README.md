# hello_cdn

This example shows how to connect to a party server, load a shared data object, and read and write to it. It also shows how to share a p5 color.

This example is the same as `hello_party` but using a cdn to load p5.party. The JavaScript is exactly the same, the only difference is in the html file.

Loading p5.party from a CDN is handy for quick sketching.

Loading the latest version from the CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5.party@latest/dist/p5.party.js"></script>
```

Loading a specific version from the CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5.party@0.6.0/dist/p5.party.js"></script>
```
