# How to update your local fork with upstream changes

You have forked p5.party and cloned it to your own machine.

You made a change (a bug fix or new feature).

You want to update your fork (both the local clone and on github) with the latest changes from the main p5.party repo.

[Github Docs — Collaborating with Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)
[Github Docs — Syncing a Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)

To prepare, if you haven't added the upstream branch:

```
 git remote add upstream https://github.com/jbakse/p5.party.git
```

Make sure you are on the local master branch.

```
git checkout main
```

Fetch the commits from your "upstream" remote that points to p5.party

```
git fetch upstream
```

Merge them in

```
git merge upstream/master
```
